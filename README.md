## Introduction

Bellabeat is a wellness technology company that designs smart health products targeted at women. This project involves analyzing fitness and sleep data to uncover trends that could help Bellabeat understand its users' wellness habits and improve its products and marketing strategies. This case study follows the "Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act" framework of the Google Data Analytics program.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes daily activity and sleep records from Fitbit users. It captures key metrics such as:
- **Daily Activity**: Total steps, calories burned, and various levels of activity (e.g., sedentary, lightly active).
- **Sleep Patterns**: Total time in bed, total minutes asleep, and frequency of sleep records.

This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of users' daily habits, which enables the identification of patterns and correlations between physical activity and sleep quality.

## Analysis and Insights

The analysis focuses on five key visualizations to reveal trends in user behavior:

1. **Total Steps vs. Sedentary Minutes**  
   - **Insight**: An inverse relationship was observed between steps and sedentary minutes, suggesting that individuals who take fewer steps tend to be more sedentary.

2. **Total Steps vs. Calories Burned**  
   - **Insight**: As step count increases, so does calorie burn, suggesting that walking significantly contributes to daily calorie expenditure.

3. **Total Time in Bed vs. Total Minutes Asleep (Over Time)**  
   - **Insight**: Users generally maintain consistent sleep routines, with minimal variance between time in bed and actual sleep duration.

4. **Average Calories Burned by Day of the Week**  
   - **Insight**: Users burn more calories on weekdays, especially Monday and Wednesday, with a slight reduction on weekends.

## Conclusion

The insights derived from the data suggest that Bellabeat could promote products that encourage daily activity and consistent sleep tracking. The observed trends align well with potential marketing strategies that focus on helping users maintain an active and healthy lifestyle.
